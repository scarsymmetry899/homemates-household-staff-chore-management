## Overview

Homemaker is a React + TypeScript progressive web app designed to give homeowners complete visibility and control over their household staff. It combines real-time status tracking, AI-powered commands, Telegram bot integration, and NFC-based attendance into a single polished interface.

Built for mobile-first use — the entire UI is optimised for phone screens with native-feel animations, pull-to-refresh, swipe gestures, and haptic-friendly interactions.

## Features

### Staff Management
- Add household staff with role, department, salary, shift timings, start date and photo

### Attendance & Status
- Live status board: On Duty / Late / Absent / En Route / Off Duty

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/scarsymmetry899/homemates-household-staff-chore-management.git
cd homemates-household-staff-chore-management

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in your keys (see Environment Variables section)

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

App will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Other Scripts

```bash
npm run build        # Production build
npm run preview      # Preview production build locally
npm run lint         # ESLint check
npm run test         # Run Vitest tests
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following keys:

```env
# Firebase
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Telegram Bot
VITE_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token

# Google Gemini AI
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

All three integrations are optional — the app runs in demo mode if keys are not provided.

---

## Firebase Setup

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and create a project
2. Enable **Authentication** → Sign-in methods → enable **Google** and **Email/Password**
3. Under **Authentication → Settings → Authorized Domains**, add:
   - `localhost` (for development)
   - Your production domain
4. Create a **Firestore** database (start in test mode for development)
5. Copy your project config keys into `.env.local`

### Cloud Functions (optional)
The `functions/` directory contains Cloud Functions for:
- `sendTelegramMessage` — callable function to proxy Telegram messages server-side
- `telegramWebhook` — HTTP endpoint for webhook mode
- `logNfcAttendance` — callable function to log NFC check-ins to Firestore
- `dailyAttendanceSummary` — scheduled function (9 PM IST) for daily digest

```bash
cd functions
npm install
firebase deploy --only functions
```

---

## Telegram Bot Setup

1. Open Telegram and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts to create your bot
3. Copy the bot token into `VITE_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env.local`
4. Start the app — it will automatically register all slash commands with Telegram on first load
5. Go to **Settings** in the app and paste your personal Telegram Chat ID (find it via [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot))

The bot uses long-polling (no public server required). Commands are processed client-side in the browser.

---

## Gemini AI Setup

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)
2. Create an API key
3. Add it to `.env.local` as `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`

The app uses **Gemini 1.5 Flash** for:
- **Smart Command Box** — multi-turn chat with live staff/expense context injection
- **Receipt Scanner** — vision model reads receipt images and extracts line items

---

## NFC Attendance Tags

> Hardware delivery pending — software is fully implemented and ready.

The app uses the **Web NFC API** (Chrome on Android) to read physical NFC tags for hands-free staff check-in/out.

### How it works
1. Each staff member gets a programmable NFC tag (NTAG213 or similar)
2. The tag is programmed with the staff member's ID
3. When tapped against the device, the app reads the tag, toggles their check-in/out status, logs to Firestore, updates Google Sheets, and sends a Telegram notification

### Programming tags (once delivered)
Navigate to **Settings → NFC Tags** in the app and tap "Program Tag" — follow the on-screen prompts to write the staff ID to the tag.

### Requirements
- Android device with NFC
- Chrome browser (Web NFC is not supported on iOS)
- Tags: NTAG213, NTAG215, or NTAG216

## Feature Deep-Dive

### Smart Command Box
The floating ✨ sparkle button opens the AI assistant. It operates in two modes:

**Gemini mode** (when API key is set): Full natural language understanding with live context injection. Gemini sees all staff names, statuses, tasks, and recent expenses before answering. Action blocks (`<action>{...}</action>`) in responses are parsed and executed automatically.

**Regex fallback**: When Gemini is not configured, a pattern-matching engine handles common queries and commands.

**Guided commands**: Tapping "Mark late", "Mark absent", or "Mark present" chips starts a guided flow — the assistant asks for the staff member's name, executes the action, and sends a Telegram notification to the owner.

### Attendance Grid (Insights)
The grid shows coloured cells per staff member per day:
- 🟢 **Green** — Present
- 🟡 **Amber** — Late
- 🔴 **Red** — Absent
- ⚫ **Grey** — Off duty

Today's column is always highlighted with a secondary-colour header dot and a ring around each cell. Long-press any cell to manually override its status.

### Receipt Scanner
1. Tap **Scan Receipt** in the Expenses tab
2. Upload or photograph a receipt
3. Gemini Vision reads the image and returns a structured list of line items with categories and amounts
4. Review each item — approve ✅ or reject ❌
5. Tap **Add Approved** to log all approved items as expenses

### Excel Export
The **Export Excel Report** button in Insights downloads a `.xlsx` file with:
- **Summary** sheet — staff counts, expense totals by category, active alerts
- **Staff** sheet — name, role, department, status, shift, punctuality %, reliability %
- **Tasks** sheet — all assignments with completion status
- **Expenses** sheet — full ledger with date, category, amount, description

---

## Deployment

### Vercel / Netlify
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy the dist/ folder
```

Set all `VITE_*` environment variables in your hosting provider's dashboard.

### Firebase Hosting
```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Important: Authorized Domains
After deploying to a custom domain, add it to **Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized Domains** so Google sign-in continues to work.

## Re-triggering the Onboarding Tour

To show the onboarding tour again (e.g. for a new user on a shared device):

```javascript
// Run in browser console
localStorage.removeItem("homemaker_onboarding_done");
location.reload();
```
